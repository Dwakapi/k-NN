# k-NN algorithm introduction
Library that allows you to implement k nearest neighbors algorithm.

With k-NN classification, the output is class membership. An object is classified based on multiple votes of its neighbors, and the object is assigned to the most frequent class among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, usually small). If k = 1, the object will simply be assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.

<h1> Project description </h1>
In the project we use two algorithms: merge sort and k nearest neighbors. Merge sort works by splitting an array into smaller subarrays, sorting each subarray, and then merging the sorted subarrays back together to form a final sorted array. It is one of the least time-consuming sorting and is needed to arrange the distances of neighbors from each other in order, along with the description of the class of membership. A k-nearest-neighbor algorithm,, is an approach to data classification that estimates how likely a data point is to be a member of one group or the other depending on what group the data points nearest to it are in.
