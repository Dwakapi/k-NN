# k-NN
Library that allows you to implement k nearest neighbors algorithm.

With k-NN classification, the output is class membership. An object is classified based on multiple votes of its neighbors, and the object is assigned to the most frequent class among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, usually small). If k = 1, the object will simply be assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.
